# Sweets-and-Treats-Bakery
## Project Overview ##
This project is centred around a user-friendly website for a bakery. It involves HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a dynamic website that includes all important information about Sweet and Treats Bakery. I focused on accessibility as well and therefore have made the page easy to navigate for everyone. This project highlights my ability to design websites that follow accessibility guidelines, best practices for web development, and made sure the website meets industry standards.

## Content ##
About Section: A detailed description of what the bakery offers and their commitment to delivering the best products possible to their customers.
Menu Section: A page that displays all menu items including baked goods, sandwiches, and drinks.

## Technologies Used ##
#### HTML: This language was used to create the structure of the pages and build a skeleton for the website.
#### CSS: This language was used to stylize the pages and add effects, colours, and a smooth user experience, this made the website dynamic and functional.
#### Javascript: This language was used to make elements of the pages responsive such as creating dropdowns and flipping info cards to show nutrition facts of certain items.
