# Sweets-and-Treats-Bakery
## Project Overview ##
This project is centred around a user-friendly website for a bakery. It involves HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a dynamic website that includes all important information about Sweet and Treats Bakery. I focused on accessibility as well, making the website easy to navigate for everyone. This project highlights my ability to design websites from scratch, follow accessibility guidelines and best practices for web development, and make sure the website meets industry standards. This was my first website project where I used key principles of HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a fully comprehensive site that includes everything a bakery website would need.

## Content ##
#### About Section: A detailed description of what the bakery offers and their commitment to delivering the best products possible to their customers.

## Technologies Used ##
#### HTML: This language was used to create the structure of the pages and build a skeleton for the website.
#### CSS: This language was used to stylize the pages and add effects, colours, and a smooth user experience, this made the website dynamic and functional.
#### Javascript: This language was used to make elements of the pages responsive such as creating dropdowns and flipping info cards to show nutrition facts of certain items.

#### GitHub/GitHub Pages: This platform was used to deploy my website so anyone can access it and use it.
